Aberdeen	Kurt Cobain	"In a community that stresses macho male sexual stories as a highlight of all conversationI was under-developed, immature, fat little dude that never got laid, and was constantly harassed!Oh, poor little kid!It bothered me, probably more so because I was horny, and frequently had to make up stories like""Uh, when I went on vacation, I met this chick, and we fucked, and she loved it!""Et cetera, et ceteraThis typical pubescent problem was in effectDuring the height of my problems with my father and stepmomYou know, the typical wicked-stepmom storyAnd so, I moved to both grandparents and four sets of aunts and unclesAnd so forth and so on within the yearAnd in eighth grade, my mom had no choice but take me inBecause my dad packed my stuff and drove me to her house in the morning and left me thereShe was pissedI accumulated quite a healthy complex, not to mention a complexionThen one day I discovered the most ultimate form of expression everMarijuanaOh, boy, pot!I could escape all day long and not have the habit routine nervous breakdowns once a weekOnly being stoned for the first few times was what I claimed as""Something I would do for the rest of my life""And I would practically do anything to ensure my supply of the fantastic weedTrevor was a guy I hated, but resorted to becoming friends withBecause he was the only person I could get pot fromHe was the kingpinTrevor, Ace, John and DarrenAll white-trash, lowlifes, scums of the Earth according to the jocksHad been going to this girl's house after school, and they invited meWe got to the door and a very fat girl let us inIt wasn't obvious to me for over an hour that this girl seemed kind of quietUntil one of the guys pointed out that she was in a special-ed classI'm sure a lot o' kids would call her a retard and some just slowAnd at the time, and still to this day, I would call her quiet and illiterate, but not retardedThe object of the guys who had been going there for the past monthWas to steal booze from the downstairs basement den of her houseWhile others distracted her by opening cupboards and doors and pretending to eat all the foodOne would go down and take a fifth, and then exit out the downstairsSo we'd do this routine every other day, and got away with it for only about a monthAnd during that month, happened to be the epitome of the mental abuse from my motherIt turned out that pot didn't help me escape my troubles too well anymoreAnd I was actually enjoying doing rebellious things like stealing booze and busting store windowsAnd nothing ever matteredI decided within the next month, I'll not sit on my roof and think about jumpingBut I'll actually kill myselfAnd I wasn't going out from this world without actually knowing what it was like to get laidSo one day after school, I went to the girl's house aloneAnd invited myself in, and she offered me some TwinkiesAnd I sat on her lap and I said""Let's fuck""And I touched her tits and she went into her bedroom and got undressed in front of meAnd I watched and realized that it was actually happeningSo I tried to fuck her but didn't know howAnd I asked her if she had ever done this beforeAnd she said, ""A lot of times, "" mainly with her cousinI got grossed out very heavily with how her vagina smelled and her sweat reekedSo I leftMy conscience grew to where I couldn't go to school for a weekAnd when I went back I got in-house suspension for skippingAnd that day, the girl's father came inScreaming and accusing someone of taking advantage of his daughterAnd so during lunch the rumor started, and by the next dayEveryone was waiting for me to yell and cuss and spit at me and callin' me ""The retard fuckerI couldn't handle the ridicule, so I got high and drunk, and walked down to the train tracks, and laid downAnd put two big pieces of cement on my chest and legs and I waited for the eleven o'clock trainAnd the train came closer, and closer, and closerAnd it went on the next track besides me, instead of over meThe tension from school had an effect on me, and so I couldn't attend the school anymoreAnd the train scared me enough to try to rehabilitate myself byBy lifting weights and, and mathematics seemed to be improving, so I became less manically depressedBut still never had any friends because II hated everyone, for they were so phony"	Yes	Sex	Loneliness	Nostalgia	Place	Depression	Depression	Struggles	0.23	0.15	0.28	0.28	0.28	0.2
